<a name="section2" id="section2"><h2>2. Full Spec</h2></a>

<p>This spec is broken into three parts - configuration, the consumer request and the provider response.</p>

<p>An oEmbed exchange occurs between a <i>consumer</i> and a <i>provider</i>. A <i>consumer</i> wishes to show an embedded representation of a third party resource on their own web site, such as a photo or an embedded video. A <i>provider</i> implements the oEmbed API to allow <i>consumers</i> to fetch that representation.</p>
